Template: pgdumper/annoy
Type: string
Default: sysadmins@catalyst.net.nz
Description: Send e-mail to:
 Space-separated list of who to annoy with messages from the script.
 Please make sure this is going to somewhere useful - 
 sysadmins@catalyst is probably not specific enough!

Template: pgdumper/backupcopies
Type: string
Default: 5
Description: Number of backup copies kept.
 How many backup copies we should have at any one time.
 The number of backup copies available at any one time.
 Keeping one copy means that the databases are dumped ready for real backing up to
 take place (eg to tape or other long-term storage).
 Keeping more than one copy means you're less likely to need to go to long term
 storage to retreive a backup.

Template: pgdumper/skipdb
Type: string
Description: Databases to skip
 A space-separated list of databases that should not be backed up by this
 script. Note that template0 is always skipped.
